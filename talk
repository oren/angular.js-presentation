you got to leave behind the 'jqeury way'. 
in jQuery when u want to change the UI, you bind to an event and manipulate the dom.
in angular, you change your model.

service - share state across controllers.
directive - manipulating the dom.
the only place where u use jQuery is when you create your own directives.
